### Project Description: 

The Wake Cafeteria Order Management System is a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of placing, managing, and preparing food orders in a cafeteria setting. The system employs a queue-based structure to organize and process customer orders efficiently. We chose this to demonstrate the use of a queue-based data structure in a real-world scenario!
